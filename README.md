[Underworld Snake Game || MK]( https://frangelicomk.github.io/MS2-Snake-Project/#)

This is my 2nd Project for Code Institute, which futures Javascript. While I had many options to choose for a game I have decided to go with my all times 
favourite classic "The Snake Game". Back then as a kid I used to watch a lot of disney movies and I couldnt stop watching Disney Hercules Movie. I like the way
Disney designed Hades hair so that is why the Theme of this game is the Underworld.

## User Experience (UX)

+ ### User Stories

    + First Time Visitors

      For first time Visitors my aim is to make them feel like kids again and bring back memories of the 90's Snake game 
      and an old time Classic Movie Hercules.

    + Returing Visitors

      Snake Game is fun, my aim is to improve this game in the future with different themes and challenges as I want the users to come back in this
      game and try more and more challenges each time. As the gaming industry advances it appears that users will not play that much an offline game
      as an online game with constant changes,themes and challenges added on regular basis.
+ ### Design

  + Colour Scheme

     + I used mainly white color for fonts and I used JS to change the colors of the socials when hovered by picking random colors 
     from the RGB wheel. The theme is Dark Colored to match the background.

  + Typography 

     + 'Amatic SC', cursive is the main font I used for the whole project, I was looking for a font to match Hercules movie from Disney but
     I couldnt find anything apart the Amatic from google fonts website.
  
  + Imagery 
     
     + I didnt use images from the web, I wish I had more time to draw my own artwork for this game but instead I used 3 screenshots from the actual Disney
     Movie "Hercules"

+ ### Wireframes
  
   + I removed the embed images as they were covering the whole markdown and users has to scroll long way through, I have done a research and it is rather complicated to make a download function on the markdown as github stops the download function.
   + Please if you want to view the wireframes navigate on my github repository on the project and find the folder assets, click on that folder and find the folder with a name wireframes, click on that folder to view the the wireframes or click [here!](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/MS2-Snake-Project/tree/main/assets/wireframes)

## Features

+ Responsive on all device sizes
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Interactive Elements 
+ Animation done in CSS3
+ A classic Snake game

## Upcoming Features 

+ The game isn't user frendly when the site opens in very small divices or IPADS due to the joystick
in the future I am planing to transfer this game in a game app and using Angular to have a proper joystick for the SNAKE. 
+ Themed games will be comming in the future. An example is: When the user achieves a X score he wins the game and moves to the next level or challenge.
each level/challenge will make the game more challenging. Food that will be spawning will have different properties and the Snake Will be able to gain powers
+ Contact form and Leaderboards will come in the future
+ I wanted to add 2 buttons. One button for the user to be able to enable and disable sounds and 1 more button to change the language of the game. For start
ENG/GR/ITA/DUTCH will be available.
+ Animated intro was the initial plan to be added so the user can interact with "Hades" and other Greek Gods "Spoiler Alert" but I run out of time. So this will be now an upcoming future.
+ Stay tunned as more updates will be comming , your feedback is very valuable.

## Testing

JS Hint, The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of <br>the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. Color Contrast checker Coolors used to check the contrast and also pick the right colour palette for
the website.

+ [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri+with_options)

### Testing User Stories
+ User Stories

   + I have added a READ the RULES section for the user to read the rules of the game. Also there is an option to start the game and get back to rules 
   later on.

+ Tested by friends from Instagram and colleagues in differnt divices

  + I have posted the link of the deployed website on my Instagram page and asked from friends and family to provide a feedback
  since I have started the project.
  
+ Feedback
  
  + The feedback of the game was positive, different users asked for different sounds when the snake eats the food and when the game over screen appears.
  A user asked if I could add theme music on the back ground as well and match the sounds of the snake when it moves. These will be considered in the future.
  Game works better on PC and it is difficult to control when on a phone due to the joystick.
  

### Further Testing
+ The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Safari browsers.
+ The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S20 Ultra and iPhoneX.
+ Friends, Colleagues from work and family members were asked to review the site and documentation <br>to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
+ I personally have access in 27" 2K Monitor, a 17" Laptop, Android phone which I constatly used for testing.
+ I have used Chrome Developer Tools as Opera Dev Tools to constantly check the website responsivness.
+ As I dont want more images on the markdown please find the testing screenshots on the testing folder. This can be achieved if you navigate on my github page then go to MK-PORTFOLIOWEB-MS1 project there you will find a folder named assets
if you click on there you will see a subfolder testing. If you right click on that folder you will see the images I have uploaded.
Alternatively you can click [here](https://github.com/Frangelicomk/MS2-Snake-Project/tree/main/assets/testing) to see the folder on my github straight away.

### Difficulties Encountered & Bugs
+ The most difficult part is to make the game controls more responsive. When I first wrote the code I used If statements for the directions of the snake
and this led to issues while controling the snake either with keyboard or joystick. This bug fixed by replacing the If statements with Switch/Case statements.
+ For some reason SAFARI users can not play the game as when the snake eats the food, snake and food dissappear. I believe this is due to the navigator vibrate function.
as before that a friend was able to play the game on an iphone. After some changes on that fuction vibration on mobiles was working but not on Iphones. I couldnt find a solution
for this, I have asked on slack twice and my mentor and I have no solution for this yet. I left the vibration there as most of the users tested the game have Android phones and the experience when
playing with vibration was much better.
+ I found it difficult changing input style inside the bubble chat. and also designing the bubble:after was impossible. while i found a solution in W3Schools side and MDN making this responsive 
was taking so long. So i gave up on this this future for the moment.
+ 12.03.2022 : After a lot of people tested the game there were 2 occations where the food spawned in the snake. (reason still unknown).
+ 12.03.2022 : Joystick needs improvement as the site isnt responsive on very small divices with height less than 800pixes. changing this will make the game area tiny. using Z-index for the joystick
due to the was it was designed will take to much of a space. Again this is a future to be fixed later on.
+ 12.03.2022 : While the user can not go Down while going UP or LEFT while going RIGHT and vice verca there is a bug that when you follow a direction and quick press 2 buttons the snake will move back
wards causing GAME OVER. again I have asked in SLACK and my TUTOR and this issue still havent been fixed.
